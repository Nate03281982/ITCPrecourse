    <h2 class="ew">Education And Work Experience</h2>
    <h3 class="text">I have always been interested in web development.  In high school and college I created websites for class projects. After making Aliyah in 2017, I start to gain professional web development skills. Initially through Udacityâ€™s Front End web design boot camp, which was a course that I financed by a scholarship that I received from Google.  In this course I was introduced to HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery and React.  I later took a job as a WordPress developer for a year and a half. Aside from using WordPress, I also used CSS on a daily basis in this position.  I am eager to learn more web development skills.</h3>
